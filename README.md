**Running with Docker-Compose**

- In the root directory of the project run "**docker-compose up**" command.
- Wait all containers to start.
- Browse http://localhost:5001

**Notes**
- api service keeps waiting till mssql container ready to accept connections. This waiting feature was implemented with wait-for-it.
(https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it)
- redis and rabbitmq containers are faster than mssql container on starting and accepting connections.That's why api service waits only mssql.
- mssql, redis and rabbitmq volumes are exist and active by defauls in docker-compose.yml
-React hot-reloading is working on development environment.
